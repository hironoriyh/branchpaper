introduce the global design
	taking branches as our materials, our goal is to design and fabricate a fence with preserving the native branch forms.
	
0:25	With our online platform, we make building with local natural materials 
more accessible playful and feasible.

0:32 	After collecting branches, they ar ecut in lengths and attached on plates with 0.5x0.5m

0:39	each plate is scanned and a mesh model is aquired.
	the scanned model ...

0:42	the online game downloads the stored data.
	users can contribute to the fence design. 

0:50 	the submitted layout is available for CNC milling process.

1:12 	user can click the fixture points to set them as invalid points. 

1:24	a user with id selects a target..
	they can see layouts by others

1:37	the user selects a plate among the uploaded branch plates

2:39	our joinery only takes a pair of branch one of which is flipped.
	This constraint is reflected in the game.
