Diverse forms of natural materials have been used in architecture since primitive shelters, however, the use of them in modern buildings is limited due to their irregular properties.
In this paper, we take the diversity as playful inputs for design task, and present our game-based design-fabrication platform for customized architectural elements.
Taking tree branches as a material in native forms, the game \textit{BranchConnect} enables end users to design feasible layouts of branches with simple scoring system and graphical feedback.
The game also considers constraints in subsequent milling process fabricating customized unique lap-joint at each connection.
Not only playing the game, but users can upload branches found at hand by mobile devices and use them in the game.
For validating our process, we conducted a workshop with children and their parents from a local community.
They collected branches in a nearby forest and contributed to design and fabricate a 2D fence with our system.
