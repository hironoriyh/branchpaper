Diverse natural materials such as stones and woods have been used as architectural elements preserving their native forms since primitive shelters, however, the use of them in modern buildings is limited due to their irregular properties.
In this paper, we take the diversity as playful inputs for design task, and present our game-based design-fabrication platform for customized architectural elements.
Taking tree branches as a material in native forms, a game \textit{BranchConnect} enables end users to design layouts of branches two-dimensionally and fabricate designs by a CNC router.
Taking irregular forms of branches, each connection has a customized unique lap-joint.
The scoring system of the game guides users to design feasible solutions with given branches and fabrication constraints, such as movable axis limitations with ordinal 3-axis CNC routers.
Not only playing the game, but users can also upload branches to our online platform by collecting and scanning branches found in their environment at hand and scan them by mobile devices.
For validating our process, we conducted a workshop with children and their parents from a local community.
They collected branches in a nearby forest and contributed to design and fabricate a 2D fence with our system.
