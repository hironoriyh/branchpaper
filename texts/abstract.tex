Diverse forms of natural materials has been used in living environments since primitive shelters to traditional architecture.
Taking irregular properties of such materials as playful inputs, we present our game-based layout design process for fabricating customized architectural elements.
Taking tree branches as a material in native forms, the game \textit{BranchConnect} enables end users to design feasible layouts of branches with simple scoring system and graphical feedback.
The game also considers fabrication constraints so that layouts can be easily realized by milling customized lap-joint at each connection.
Not only playing the game, but users can also scan and upload branches found at hand which are used in the game.
For validating our process, we conducted a workshop with children and their parents from a local community.
They collected branches in a nearby forest and contributed to design and fabricate a 2D fence with the presented system.
